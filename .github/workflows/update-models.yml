            ## Automated model update

            This PR was created automatically by a scheduled GitHub Action that
            fetches the latest model identifiers from the official OpenAI and
            Anthropic SDK packages and updates the TypeScript type unions in
            `@inngest/ai`.

            Models are only added, never removed.
