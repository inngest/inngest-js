    Inngest is the reliability layer for modern applications. It combines durable execution, events, and queues into a zero-infra platform with built-in observability.

    Inngest enables serverless event-driven queues, background jobs, and scheduled jobs for TypeScript. Works with any framework and platform.

## Getting started

<br />

Install Inngest:

```bash
npm install inngest  # or yarn add inngest
```

### Writing functions

Write serverless functions and background jobs right in your own code:

```ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "my-app" });

// This function will be invoked by Inngest via HTTP any time
// the "app/user.signup" event is sent to to Inngest
export default inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "user-onboarding-communication" },
  { event: "app/user.signup" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.run("Send welcome email", async () => {
      await sendEmail({
        email: event.data.email,
        template: "welcome",
      });
    });
  }
);
```

- Functions are triggered by events which can be sent via this SDK, webhooks, integrations, or with a simple HTTP request.
- When a matching event is received, Inngest invokes the function automatically, with built-in retries.

### Serving your functions

Inngest invokes functions via HTTP, so you need to _serve_ them using an adapter for the framework of your choice. [See all frameworks here in our docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/serve?ref=github-inngest-js-readme). Here is an example using the Next.js serve handler:

```ts
// /pages/api/inngest.ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
// See the "inngest/next" adapter imported here:
import { serve } from "inngest/next";
import myFunction from "../userOnboardingCOmmunication"; // see above function

// You can create this in a single file and import where it's needed
const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "my-app" });

// Securely serve your Inngest functions for remote invocation:
export default serve(inngest, [myFunction]);
```

### Sending events to trigger functions

```ts
// Send events
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "my-app" });

// This will run the function above automatically, in the background
inngest.send("app/user.signup", {
  data: { email: "text@example.com", user_id: "12345" },
});
```

- Events can trigger one or more functions automatically, enabling you to fan-out work.
- Inngest stores a history of all events for observability, testing, and replay.

## Features

- **Fully serverless:** Run background jobs, scheduled functions, and build event-driven systems without any servers, state, or setup
- **Works with your framework**: Works with [Next.js, Redwood, Express, Cloudflare Pages, Nuxt, Fresh (Deno), and Remix](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/serve?ref=github-inngest-js-readme)
- **Deploy anywhere**: Keep [deploying to your existing platform](https://www.inngest.com/docs/deploy?ref=github-inngest-js-readme): Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, Deno, Digital Ocean, etc.
- **Use your existing code:** Write functions within your current project and repo
- **Fully typed**: Event schemas, versioning, and governance out of the box
- **Observable**: A full UI for managing and inspecting your functions
