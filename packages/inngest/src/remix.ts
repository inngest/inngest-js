 * required.
 *
 * See {@link https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/resource-routes}

 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { serve } from "inngest/remix";
 * import functions from "~/inngest";
 *
 * const handler = serve({ id: "my-remix-app", functions });
 *
 * export { handler as loader, handler as action };
