# inngest

## 2.4.1

### Patch Changes

- f2ffc8b: Fix `cross-fetch` import issue in testing environemtnst. API package also uses custom `fetch` passed via arguments.
- acfa07c: Throw error when using `inngest/express` and not using a body parser
- b535e1e: Ensure users are not allowed to configure batching with cancellation or rate limiting, as these features do not yet function together
- c271eb1: Add `x-inngest-no-retry: true` header when non-retriable for internal executor changes
- 2a93f0b: Fix `onFailure` functions missing types applied by middleware

## 2.4.0

- 6cb6719: Allow filtering of events within triggers

### Patch Changes

- 55c889c: Expose raw error message if status is unknown

### Minor Changes

- 7792a62: Add support for streaming to `inngest/remix`

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 1120e29: Genercize mixed async error; the same symptom can be caused by a few different errors

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d0a8976: Add support for batching events.

  Introduces a new configuration to function configurations.

  ```ts
  batchEvents?: { maxSize: 100, timeout: "5s" }
  ```

  This will take Inngest start execution when one of the following conditions are met.

  1. The batch is full
  2. Time is up

  When the SDK gets invoked, the list of events will be available via a newly exported field `events`.

  ```ts
  createFunction(
    { name: "my func", batchEvents: { maxSize: 100, timeout: "5s" } },
    { event: "my/event" },
    async ({ event, events, step }) => {
      // events is accessible with the list of events
      // event will still be a single event object, which will be the
      // 1st event of the list.

      const result = step.run("do something with events", () => {
        return events.map(() => doSomething());
      });

      return { success: true, result };
    }
  );
  ```

### Major Changes

- 4f29f5c: Removed `tools` parameter (breaking). This was marked as `@deprecated` in v1, but is being fully removed in v2. Use `step` instead.
  See the [v2 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration#clearer-event-sending).
- 4f29f5c: Renamed `throttle` to `rateLimit`.
  See the [v2 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration#clearer-event-sending).
- 4f29f5c: Added the ability to provide middleware when defining Inngest clients and functions, hooking into a client's lifecycle to add custom functionality like error monitoring, data transformations, and more.
  See [Advanced: Middleware - Inngest Documentation](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/middleware/overview).
- 4f29f5c: Removed ability to `serve()` without a client (breaking).
  See the [v2 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration#clearer-event-sending).
- 4f29f5c: Better event schema definitions (breaking), providing an extensible metho of creating and maintaining event payloads with a variety of native tools and third-party libraries.
  See [Defining Event Payload Types - Inngest Documentation](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/client/create#defining-event-payload-types).
- 4f29f5c: Removed some overloads of `inngest.send()` to provide a better TS experience when sending events (breaking).
  See the [v2 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration#clearer-event-sending).

### Minor Changes

- 4f29f5c: Added a `logger` to Inngest functions in addition to allowing users to provide a custom logger to reliably push logs to external services and handle flushing on serverless environments.
  See [Logging in Inngest - Inngest Documentation](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/logging).
- 4f29f5c: Add `GetEvents<>` export which can be used to pull final event types from an Inngest client.
  See [Defining Event Payload Types](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/client/create#defining-event-payload-types).
- 4f29f5c: Add ability to provide `concurrency: { limit: number }` in function config, ready for more config options.

  Affects the public API, so will therefore be a package bump, but shouldn't affect any expected areas of use.

  Including a bump for this as it does seem to fix some complex inference for future features.
