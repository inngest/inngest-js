## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#294](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/pull/294) [`f2f4856`](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/commit/f2f4856ab97d4191587ea1f41e9fe18b5ef45c95) Thanks [@jpwilliams](https://github.com/jpwilliams)! - Clients and functions now require IDs

  When instantiating a client using `new Inngest()` or creating a function via `inngest.createFunction()`, it's now required to pass an `id` instead of a `name`.

  Previously only `name` was required, but this implied that the value was safe to change. Internally, we used this name to _produce_ an ID which was used during deployments and executions.

  See the [v3 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration).

- [#294](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/pull/294) [`f2f4856`](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/commit/f2f4856ab97d4191587ea1f41e9fe18b5ef45c95) Thanks [@jpwilliams](https://github.com/jpwilliams)! - Refactored available environment variables and configuration

  The arrangement of environment variables available has shifted a lot over the course of v2, so in v3 we've streamlined what's available and how they're used.

  See the [v3 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration).

- [#294](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/pull/294) [`f2f4856`](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/commit/f2f4856ab97d4191587ea1f41e9fe18b5ef45c95) Thanks [@jpwilliams](https://github.com/jpwilliams)! - In v2, providing a `fns` option when creating a function -- an object of functions -- would wrap those passed functions in `step.run()`, meaning you can run code inside your function without the `step.run()` boilerplate.

  This wasn't a very well advertised feature and had some drawbacks, so we're instead replacing it with some optional middleware.

  See the [v3 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration).

- [#294](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/pull/294) [`f2f4856`](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/commit/f2f4856ab97d4191587ea1f41e9fe18b5ef45c95) Thanks [@jpwilliams](https://github.com/jpwilliams)! - Serving functions could become a bit unwieldy with the format we had, so we've slightly altered how you serve your functions to ensure proper discoverability of options and aid in readability when revisiting the code.

  See the [v3 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration).

- [#294](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/pull/294) [`f2f4856`](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/commit/f2f4856ab97d4191587ea1f41e9fe18b5ef45c95) Thanks [@jpwilliams](https://github.com/jpwilliams)! - Shorthand function creation removed

  `inngest.createFunction()` can no longer take a string as the first or second arguments; an object is now required to aid in the discoverability of options and configuration.

  See the [v3 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration).

- [#294](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/pull/294) [`f2f4856`](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/commit/f2f4856ab97d4191587ea1f41e9fe18b5ef45c95) Thanks [@jpwilliams](https://github.com/jpwilliams)! - All steps require IDs

  When using any step.\* tool, an ID is now required to ensure that determinism across changes to a function is easier to reason about for the user and the underlying engine.

  The addition of these IDs allows you to deploy hotfixes and logic changes to long-running functions without fear of errors, failures, or panics. Beforehand, any changes to a function resulted in an irrecoverable error if step definitions changed. With this, changes to a function are smartly applied by default.

  See the [v3 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration).

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#202](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/pull/202) [`21053ed`](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/commit/21053edeb5a11f2eaa0242d56d36b0aee6ae994f) Thanks [@djfarrelly](https://github.com/djfarrelly)! - Add support for Fastify, either via a custom `.route()` or using a Fastify plugin

  ```ts
  import Fastify from "fastify";
  import inngestFastify, { serve } from "inngest/fastify";
  import { functions, inngest } from "./inngest";

  const fastify = Fastify({
    logger: true,
  });

  // The lead maintainer of Fastify recommends using this as a plugin:
  fastify.register(inngestFastify, {
    client: inngest,
    functions,
    options: {},
  });

  // We do also export `serve()` if you want to use it directly, though.
  fastify.route({
    method: ["GET", "POST", "PUT"],
    handler: serve(inngest, functions),
    url: "/api/inngest",
  });

  fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, function (err, address) {
    if (err) {
      fastify.log.error(err);
      process.exit(1);
    }
  });
  ```

- [#298](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/pull/298) [`4984aa8`](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/commit/4984aa85b97fd7b3d38d4fdcb5559c0ecb4307a3) Thanks [@z.object({](https://github.com/z.object({), [@z.object({](https://github.com/z.object({)! - Add the ability to provide Zod schemas using `z.object()` instead of requiring a record format

  ```ts
  // Previously we supported this
  new EventSchemas().fromZod({
    "test.event": {
      data: z.object({ a: z.string() }),
   b: z.number() }),
    },
  });

  // Now we ALSO support this
  new EventSchemas().fromZod([
    z.object({
      name: z.literal("test.event"),
      data: z.object({ a: z.string() }),
   b: z.number() }),
    }),
  ]);
  ```

  This should help if you wish to declare your events piece-by-piece instead of in a single object.

  ```ts
  const firstEvent = z.object({
    name: z.literal("app/user.created"),
    data: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
  });

  const secondEvent = z.object({
    name: z.literal("shop/product.deleted"),
    data: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
  });

  new EventSchemas().fromZod([firstEvent, secondEvent]);
  ```

  You can use the exported `LiteralZodEventSchema` type to provide some autocomplete when writing your events, too.

  ```ts
  const ShopProductOrdered = z.object({
    name: z.literal("shop/product.ordered"),
    data: z.object({ productId: z.string() }),
  }) satisfies LiteralZodEventSchema;
  ```

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d0a8976: Add support for batching events.

  Introduces a new configuration to function configurations.

  ```ts
  batchEvents?: { maxSize: 100, timeout: "5s" }
  ```

  This will take Inngest start execution when one of the following conditions are met.

  1. The batch is full
  2. Time is up

  When the SDK gets invoked, the list of events will be available via a newly exported field `events`.

  ```ts
  createFunction(
    { name: "my func", batchEvents: { maxSize: 100, timeout: "5s" } },
    { event: "my/event" },
    async ({ event, events, step }) => {
      // events is accessible with the list of events
      // event will still be a single event object, which will be the
      // 1st event of the list.

      const result = step.run("do something with events", () => {
        return events.map(() => doSomething());
      });

      return { success: true, result };
    }
  );
  ```

### Major Changes

- 4f29f5c: Removed `tools` parameter (breaking). This was marked as `@deprecated` in v1, but is being fully removed in v2. Use `step` instead.
  See the [v2 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration#clearer-event-sending).
- 4f29f5c: Renamed `throttle` to `rateLimit`.
  See the [v2 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration#clearer-event-sending).
- 4f29f5c: Added the ability to provide middleware when defining Inngest clients and functions, hooking into a client's lifecycle to add custom functionality like error monitoring, data transformations, and more.
  See [Advanced: Middleware - Inngest Documentation](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/middleware/overview).
- 4f29f5c: Removed ability to `serve()` without a client (breaking).
  See the [v2 migration guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/migration#clearer-event-sending).
- 4f29f5c: Better event schema definitions (breaking), providing an extensible metho of creating and maintaining event payloads with a variety of native tools and third-party libraries.
  See [Defining Event Payload Types - Inngest Documentation](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/client/create#defining-event-payload-types).
- 4f29f5c: Removed some overloads of `inngest.send()` to provide a better TS experience when sending events (breaking).

### Minor Changes

- 4f29f5c: Added a `logger` to Inngest functions in addition to allowing users to provide a custom logger to reliably push logs to external services and handle flushing on serverless environments.
  See [Logging in Inngest - Inngest Documentation](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/logging).
- 4f29f5c: Add `GetEvents<>` export which can be used to pull final event types from an Inngest client.
  See [Defining Event Payload Types](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/client/create#defining-event-payload-types).
