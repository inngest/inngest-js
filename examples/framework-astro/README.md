# Inngest Astro Template

This is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) project bootstrapped with [`create astro`](https://docs.astro.build/en/install/auto/). It is a reference on how to send and receive events with Inngest and Astro.

## Getting Started

Use [`create astro`](https://docs.astro.build/en/install/auto/) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template inngest/inngest-js/examples/framework-astro inngest-astro
```

```bash
yarn create astro --template inngest/inngest-js/examples/framework-astro inngest-astro
```

```bash
pnpm create astro@latest --template inngest/inngest-js/examples/framework-astro inngest-astro
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/api/inngest) with your browser to see the result.

- [Inngest functions](https://www.inngest.com/docs/functions) are available at `src/inngest/`.
- The [Inngest handler](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/serve) is available a `src/pages/api/inngest.ts`.
