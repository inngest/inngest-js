# Framework ElysiaJS

## Getting Started

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Development

### Bun setup for inngest dev server

Now you can run either `bun run inngest:dev` or `npx inngest-cli@latest`.

This will start your inngest dev server at `localhost:8288`

### Developement server

To start the development server run:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ and you will see a message printed in json. Go to your inngest dev server and you should now see a completed function run with the pay load sent to that function in `./src/index.ts`. 

You are now up and running with ElysiaJS and Inngest with Bun
