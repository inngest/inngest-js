- 56b8e9a: Removes many `any` types from the internal and public APIs.

  Affects the public API, so will therefore be a package bump, but shouldn't affect any expected areas of use.

- a45601e: Update dependency typescript to v5

  Including a bump for this as it does seem to fix some complex inference for future features.

### Minor Changes

- ebb8740: Add ability to control the concurrency of a specific function via the `concurrency` option when creating an Inngest function

- a4f8ae8: Fixes a typing bug where both `event` and `cron` could be specified as a trigger at the same time.

  Multiple event triggers will be coming in a later update, but not in this format.

- d6a8329: Ensure signatures are not validated during development
- 950a2bc: Ensure `inngest.send()` and `step.sendEvent()` can be given an empty array without error
