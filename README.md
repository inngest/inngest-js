## Getting started

<br />

Install Inngest:

```bash
npm install inngest  # or yarn install inngest
```

<br />

**Writing functions**: Write serverless functions and background jobs right in your own code:

```ts
import { createFunction } from "inngest";

export default createFunction(
  "Send welcome email",
  "app/user.created", // Subscribe to the `app/user.created` event.
  ({ event }) => {
    sendEmailTo(event.data.id, "Welcome!");
  }
);
```

Functions listen to events which can be triggered by API calls, webhooks, integrations, or external services. When a matching event is received, the serverless function runs automatically, with built in retries.

<br />

**Triggering functions by events:**

```ts
// Send events
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
const inngest = new Inngest({ name: "My App" });

// This will run the function above automatically, in the background
inngest.send("app/user.created", { data: { id: 123 } });
```

Events trigger any number of functions automatically, in parallel, in the background. Inngest also stores a history of all events for observability, testing, and replay.

<br />

## Features

- **Fully serverless:** Run background jobs, scheduled functions, and build event-driven systems without any servers, state, or setup
- **Deploy anywhere**: works with NextJS, Netlify, Vercel, Redwood, Express, Cloudflare, and Lambda
- **Use your existing code:** write functions within your current project, zero learning required
- **A complete platform**: complex functionality built in, such as **event replay**, **canary deploys**, **version management** and **git integration**
- **Fully typed**: Event schemas, versioning, and governance out of the box
- **Observable**: A full UI for managing and inspecting your functions
- **Any language:** Use our CLI to write functions using any language

<br />

## Contributing

Clone the repository, then:

```sh
yarn # install dependencies
yarn dev # build/lint/test
```

We use [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to manage Node/Yarn versions.

> When making a pull request, make sure to commit the changed `etc/inngest.api.md` file; this is a generated types/docs file that will highlight changes to the exposed API.

### Locally linking (`npm|yarn link`)

In order to provide sensible namespaced imports such as `"inngest/next"`, the package actually builds to _and deploys from_ `dist/`.

To replicate this locally to test changes with other local repos, you can link the project like so (replace `npm` for `yarn` if desired):

```sh
# in this repo
yarn build
yarn prelink
cd dist/
yarn link
```

```sh
# in another repo
yarn link inngest
```
